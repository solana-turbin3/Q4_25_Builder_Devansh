Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side development?

I think solana has chosen to use Typescript for client side dev for most of its history because the Typescript environment easily connects with anchor and rust codes. Also Typescript provides a robust method to connect the Blockchain logics with the frontend. The bindings of Typescript language with rust is better than any other front end dev framework. Also Typescript is a language like JS so building on it is a bit easier.
